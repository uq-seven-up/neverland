This will be the readme file.

## Setting up for development.

If you do not want to configure all the node and react stuff you can simply checkout the source code then 
start a development environment using the start.sh script on Linux/Mac-OS or start.bat on windows.

Select the first option to launch a docker environment that contains all the tooling required to build the project.

From within the docker container you run the build.sh script to fully build all projects or navigate to the project
you want to work on and use yarn start to launch the app in a server.

To exit the container use the command: exit
