### Using Docker as a development environment.
Not recommended on Mac OS or Windows, but you can try it.

#### Windows
`./start.bat`

#### Linux / Mac OS
`./start.sh`

Then choose option 1. This will launch a docker build environment and start a bash shell inside of the linux
container. 

Inside the bash shell you can use the same commands for building and working with the source code as described for Linux.

The start.sh script also provides the option to build the docke build environment from the provided docker file.
