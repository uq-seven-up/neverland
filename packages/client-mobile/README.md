# Mobile Web Application
This package contains the source code for the mobile web application which is used
to interact with the client-screen via the server package.

## Available commands
`yarn start` Runs the mobile client in development mode and auto re-builds on code changes.  
`yarn build` Build a production version of the client. NOTE: You most likely want to use the build script in the project root instead.
