# Client Screen Application
This package contains the source code for the client screen application which powers
the public display.

## Developer notes.
The client screen relies on the server package running.

## Available commands
`yarn start` Runs the screen in development mode and auto re-builds on code changes.  
`yarn build` Build a production version of the client. NOTE: You most likely want to use the build script in the project root instead.
